# UDACITY NANODEGREEE - DATA SCIENCE 
# Capstone Project
Author: Thomas Canty
# Project Title

Starbucks has an mobile app where registered users can use it to order coffee for pickup while mobile, pay in store using a prepaid function, and collect rewards points. This app also offers promotions for bonus points to these users.
This project provided simulated data with the task to identify what is the best offer, which demographic groups respond to which offer types, and which have an adverse response to which offers.
I specified the task by trying to answer these questionsÂ :
    1. What demographics have tendencies to view offers, and which types (if applicable).
    2. What demographics have tendency to make a purchases based on the offer they viewed.
I used principle component analysis and k-mean clustering to identify tends in demographic and offer features with tendency to view offers and make purhcases based on those views.
